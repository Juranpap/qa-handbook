> *Multi-tasking is the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.*

Here's a quick rundown of the main activities you'll be involved in as a quality assurance engineer at Infinum.

Most of these will be explained into more detail during the course of this Handbook.

 - **Attending internal meetings**: Weeklies, QA workshops, and others.
 - **Attending project-related meetings**: Kick-offs, scrums and standups, "lessons learned" meetings, sprint plannings and sprint reviews... There are various project-related meetings which you should attend in order to gather and share (!) valuable information. Take your laptop, write stuff down, and make sure to listen and contribute.
 - **Testing mobile and web apps**: The cornerstone of your work is testing software and being actively involved in software development projects. This involves both manual and automated testing. Your job is to ensure that software Infinum produces is as functional and usable as possible.
 - **Writing and maintaining test cases**: This goes hand-in-hand with the above.
 - **Tracking app reviews**: Checking Google Play and/or App Store reviews for those projects that are your responsibility and acting on them if they are negative. This helps us build a positive image as a software company.
 - **Being actively involved and taking care of quality**: You are responsible for the projects you are working on. Be active, suggest improvements, implement new processes and do whatever you can to make them as good as possible.
 - **Spreading the word**: Write blog posts, attend conferences, study new technologies and trends, contribute to the community. These extracurricular activities will make you a better QA engineer in the long run. No tester is an island. :)
 
Time-tracking is an important aspect of your day-to-day life. Here's a short note on tracking your project-related work time:
 
 - **Enumerate each task you worked on or opened**: this ensures transparency
 - **Give a brief description of your activities**: e.g. "updated test cases" or "ran a smoke test on Android"
