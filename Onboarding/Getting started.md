## First day

**First things first - welcome to Infinum and the quality assurance (QA) team.** ðŸ¤—

**May your road be paved with squashed bugs and merry deployments.**

Before you can embark onto your journey, you'll have do some basic first steps and add a few tools and services to your arsenal. Once you get to work on your first day:  

- Find your team lead on the 7th floor.
- Have him/her give you a tour of the office and make you a cup of coffee or tea according to personal preference. â˜•
- Locate your table, get comfy, and by all means...
- ...get your laptop from the Office Manager (13th floor).

Now we've got something we can work with.
