This is a quick rundown of recurring events specific to the QA team.  You should find all of these scheduled in your Calendar.

They are subject to change so make sure to check your Calendar every day.

- **Mondays at 15:00: QA weekly with the Operations team (30 min)**
 	- We use this weekly meeting in order to go through all active projects with the Operations team, report progress and point out any obvious impediments.
- **Mondays at 15:30: QA workshop (1:30h)**
 	- Each week another member of the QA team will present a practical/theoretical topic in order to share knowledge and entice discussion. People from other teams can be guest speakers or just participate.
- **Wednesdays at 15.30: Team weekly (30 min)**
 	- This an informal meeting we use to summarize the week, hang out, and find out whether someone has either too little or too much work on their hands.
- **Every week: QA buddy session (1h)**
	- A round of testing with someone from your team in which you will gain insight and experience. And help a tester out. :)
- **Every second week: 1on1 (1h)**
 	- Your team lead will sit down with you every other week on any particular day for a chat about your progress, projects, issues, etc.
- **Once a month: QA team dinner (∞)**
	- When we do despicable things to plentiful varieties of flora and fauna.
- **Ad hoc: QA internal Show-off (∞)**
 	- An "informal" meeting where your teammates can present the projects they are working on while the rest of the team discusses and analyzes them. There are usualy two to three presentations on each one. Comments and jokes are welcome :)
	
Suggestions for additions or changes to this schedule are more than welcome.

Other than these recurring events, you will also get invited to project-related daily or weekly meetings. These should not overlap with the events stated above. If they do, ping your team lead or project manager to reschedule.
