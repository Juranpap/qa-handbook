### Why do we use Postman?

* To write API tests
* It has a nice and intuitive interface
* It is relatively easy to use even for newbies

### When do we use Postman
* When you want to test if the API abides to the spec
* When you want to check if the API is returning the appropriate data
* When something is not testable via the frontend app
* When you want to set up your test environment quickly

### Tutorial
* While we work on a cool Handbook article, check out [these slides](/img/postman-short.pdf) from one of our workshops.
